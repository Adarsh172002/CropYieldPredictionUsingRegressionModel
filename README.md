# Crop Yield Prediction Model using Decision Tree Regression and Django

## Requirements
- Decision Tree Regression model
- Django

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Crop Yield Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset)

## Prediction
This project aims to predict the yield of a country based on various parameters such as temperature, rainfall, and pesticide usage. By leveraging a Decision Tree Regression model, it analyzes the dataset to make predictions on crop yield. 

## Additional Points
- **Feature Engineering**: Describe any feature engineering techniques used to preprocess the data before modeling.
- **Model Evaluation**: Discuss how the Decision Tree Regression model was evaluated and any metrics used to assess its performance.
- **Django Integration**: Explain how Django was integrated into the project, whether it's for building a web interface for the model, creating APIs, or any other purpose.
- **Deployment**: If applicable, mention how the model was deployed using Django, whether it's locally or on a cloud platform.
- **Future Improvements**: Suggest any future improvements or enhancements that could be made to the project, such as incorporating additional features, optimizing the model, or improving the user interface.
